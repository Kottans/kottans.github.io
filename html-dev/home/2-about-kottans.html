                We are looking for smart, friendly, self-directed and
                intellectually curious people who enjoy programming and want to
                get significantly better.

                We are passionate about programming and think that everybody can
                pick it up or switch to the different field at any time they want,
                given some amount of motivation, dedication and hard work â€¦

                  Nevertheless, doing that on one's own can be challenging when it
                  comes to continuing without support from surrounding people,
                  such situation really beats the motivation, especially when
                  encountering either boring or impossible to do (at first glance)
                  task or illogical aspect of programming language you can't just
                  grasp.

                  That's the reason behind us getting together and sharing
                  knowledge.

                  Our initiative is community driven, making it super-flexible in
                  terms of adapting to what students want while keeping in mind
                  the main idea - learn something new and do it in the fun way,
                  creating something meaningful along the way.
