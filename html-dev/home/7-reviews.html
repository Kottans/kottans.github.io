                    It so happened that at some point I was surrounded by people
                    related to the IT industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In conversations I have again and again heard topics that were
                    unclear to me, and, judging by those conversations, web
                    development was quite a creative job (and I love to be
                    creative).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I challenged myself: "Can you do it?" And I got enrolled to
                    the course after diligently making all test assignments. Not
                    only do the Kottans explain the basics and repeat it a number
                    of times to make material completely clear, but they also help
                    to train self-organization very well (personally, my level has
                    risen). And this is a big family - there is always support in
                    chat rooms (if you’re stuck), informal outdoor parties, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And yes! I quickly found a job. Not after the first interview
                    (you need to acquire some experience points in passing the
                    interviews), but a housewife (with a long experience) without
                    formal education started to work as a Junior front-end
                    developer in the Ministry of Finance (and coded not only HTML
                    & CSS but did proper JS tasks).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is still a lot to learn, to grasp, to understand, and I
                    manage it more or less quickly - the main thing is the start,
                    and then it works like clock-work :)
